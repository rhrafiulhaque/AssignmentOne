                    <p>Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. The websites we browse, the gifts we
                        order and the news we peruse online are all made possible by the web developers who design,
                        build and implement Internet websites. They are heavily involved in website creation, from
                        helping design aesthetic properties such as layout and color, to technical considerations such
                        as how to design a website to handle a given amount of Internet traffic.</p>

                <p>Web application development is the creation of application programs that reside on remote servers and
                    are delivered to the userâ€™s device over the Internet. A web application (web app) does not need to
                    be downloaded and is instead accessed through a network. An end user can access a web application
                    through a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox. A majority of web
                    applications can be written in JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and HTML5.</p>

                    questions or having a senior developer answering questions to a self-sufficient community that
                    answers each other's questions.</p>
